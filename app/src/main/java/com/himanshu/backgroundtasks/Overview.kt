     * In this branch, we are executing a background task using `WorkManager` and `AlarmManager`.
     * The WorkManager is used to fire the AlarmManager, once all the constraints are satisfied.
     * We are also making the notification snooze for 1 minute on a notification action using the
     * `Pending Intent` with it.
